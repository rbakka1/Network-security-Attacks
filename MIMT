📌 Project Title: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Simulation
🔹 Overview
This project simulates a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using Ettercap & Wireshark in a controlled environment. The goal is to analyze network vulnerabilities, capture network traffic, and demonstrate detection and mitigation techniques.

🔹 Tools Used
🛠️ Ettercap – Packet sniffing and traffic interception
🛠️ Wireshark – Packet analysis
🛠️ Kali Linux – Attacker VM
🛠️ Ubuntu VM – Client machine
🔹 Attack Methodology
Environment Setup
Attacker: Kali Linux
Victim: Ubuntu (targeted for interception)
Execution of Attack
ARP Poisoning with Ettercap
Capturing HTTP traffic using Wireshark
Detection & Mitigation
Identifying MITM attack in Wireshark logs
Implementing HTTPS, ARP Spoofing Detection Tools
🔹 Results & Findings
Captured network traffic successfully.
Demonstrated ARP Spoofing Detection using system logs.
Suggested security measures: HTTPS, ARP table static entries.
